# Food-101 Image Classification using ResNet-50

The Food-101 dataset, a comprehensive collection of 101,000 food images across 101 categories, presents a challenging benchmark for image classification due to its intentionally noisy and mislabeled training data. This study leverages the ResNet-50 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network known for its residual learning capability, to classify food images into binary categories: sweet and savory. Extensive preprocessing, including
data cleansing, augmentation, and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was employed to prepare the dataset. Our experiments compared ResNet-50 with other models, such as VGG-16 combined with logistic regression, to highlight performance trade-offs. Preliminary results indicate that ResNet-50 achieves superior classification accuracy, show-casing its potential in fine-grained food image classification tasks.
